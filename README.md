# Monocle

## Overview

Monocle is a `Makefile` visualizer for the web.

You can use it to view a `Makefile` as a graph of its targets and their dependenciesâ€”in your web browser.

## Limitations

Monocle has the following limitations:
- It only parses a single `Makefile` (i.e. it does not follow `include` paths).

## Technologies

Monocle is built upon the following technologies:
- Node 20
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) 4
- [React](https://react.dev/) 18
- TypeScript 5
- Bootstrap 5 (via [`react-bootstrap`](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/))
- Codemirror 6 (via [`@uiw/react-codemirror`](https://uiwjs.github.io/react-codemirror/))
- Mermaid (via [`mdx-mermaid`](https://sjwall.github.io/mdx-mermaid/))
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) 3

This code base was bootstrapped by running:
```shell
npx --yes create-vite monacle --template react-ts
```

## FAQ

- Q: Why'd you name it "monocle?"
- A: Because the word "monocle" has "m", "k", and "l" sounds like the word "Makefile" does, and a monocle is a thing people use to see stuff more clearly.
